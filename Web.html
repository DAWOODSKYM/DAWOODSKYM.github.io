        <H4>Problem statement</H4>
        Cancer is the second leading cause of death from non-communicable disease (or NCDs), and the number of cases is rising rapidly.<br>
        The illness affects Kenyans of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds but has a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable groups. 
        Cervical cancer makes up the largest portion of cancer cases (nearly 12%) followed by breast cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and oesophageal and prostate cancer.
        In 2020, according to the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), new cases of all types of cancers increased to nearly 
        20 million worldwide, and there were 10 million cancer deaths (up from about 17 million and 9.5 million, respectively, in 2018). <br>
        Current IARC projections suggest that one in 5 people worldwide will develop cancer during their lifetime and that the global
        cancer burden is projected to rise by about 50% over the next 20 years.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p> The growing cancer burden is driven by aging populations,
        as well as several risk factors, such as sedentary lifestyles, obesity and smoking.
        <br> in many low- and middle-income countries, most cancer cases in Kenya are diagnosed at an advanced stage, when treatment options 
        are limited and families make huge sacrifices, often with poor results. Households not covered by health insurance frequently grasp 
        for dire financial fixes – borrowing, selling assets – that can plunge them further into insolvency.
        According to a 2018 household survey, 8% of all Kenyan households experienced catastrophic health expenditures, with out-of-pocket 
        payments pushing more than 1 million Kenyans into poverty annually.<br>
     </p>

  <div id="Results" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>  With less than 20% of the population enrolled in the national 
        health insurance scheme, financial barriers to accessing care remains problematic as many Kenyans only enroll once they become ill.
        The Kenyan government has stepped up its response to the mounting threat of cancer , but much more needs to be done. Efforts are underway
        to boost the capacity of health providers through in-service training on early cancer screening and 
        expand pre-service training to increase the availability of specialized personnel.
